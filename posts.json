    "post_content": "Hello! As I was thinking about what I would like to talk about in my very first blog, I felt slightly anxious ... and that led me to my answer! \u00a0Of course, it\u2019s completely natural to feel a surge of nervous, excited anxiety when starting something new. It can propel you on to achieving your best, to reach new heights. \u00a0 Anxiety can also warn you of impending danger ... it can be a helpful emotion that we need to survive. \u00a0Unfortunately, though, anxiety is a huge issue in many people\u2019s lives \u2013 from school children to company directors. \u00a0Many of the clients that I see, whether for hypnotherapy or counselling, come to me because they are struggling to control their anxiety. \u00a0This is sometimes related to a very specific event in their life but, more often, is simply \u2018everyday anxiety\u2019 \u2013 the stresses of work, family and relationships \u2013 those things that, in an ideal world, should be a source of enjoyment and fulfilment.\r\n\r\nSo what can we do to help to reduce anxiety levels, to make life easier and ultimately more satisfying?\u00a0 Obviously if your anxiety is severe or debilitating, you may need to see your doctor or talk things through with a counsellor.\u00a0 There are several strategies that we can all do for ourselves as well, however, and these can really help us to help manage difficult emotions and to relax more.\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Take deep breaths \u2013 even this simple step can help because deep, diaphragmatic breathing activates your body\u2019s relaxation response. Practice breathing in through your nose and out slowly through your mouth, as if you were blowing a huge bubble ... too fast and the bubble will burst!\u00a0 Give it a go and practice it so you are ready to put into action when you need to calm down.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Accept that you\u2019re anxious \u2013 and that anxiety is a natural emotion that you can manage. Like any other strong emotion, it tends to peak and then subside.\u00a0 You are learning to ride that wave, breathing deeply, until it subsides.\u00a0 Learn to surf, not become submerged!<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Question your thoughts \u2013 when people are anxious, they tend to be bombarded by all sorts of negative or outlandish ideas. The cold that you have may suddenly seem life-threatening, the speech you need to give may seem like an impossibly difficult challenge.\u00a0 Chances are, you are getting things out of proportion.\u00a0\u00a0 Once you start to question whether your thoughts are based in reality or not, you begin to realise that some of your feelings are based on negative opinion rather than truth ... and you can begin to start controlling your responses and emotions.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Use positive self-talk \u2013 \u201cThis anxiety feels bad right now but it will pass and I can use strategies to control it\u201d.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Use calming visualisation techniques \u2013 find out about how meditation and hypnotherapy can help you.

If so, you\u2019re not alone!\u00a0 Lots of things can contribute to high levels of stress and, unfortunately, work is one of them! \u00a0The teaching profession \u2018boasts\u2019 one of the highest levels of stress \u2013 if you needed proof of that, see this article by the BBC, which is a sobering tale of high workload, pressure and physical and mental illness.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/education-31921457\"><strong>http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/education-31921457<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\r\nSo, how stressed are you??

Each \u201cno\u201d represents an area to work on to become more resilient.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s important to be able to express how you feel, to have support, and to stay positive \u2013 that much is clear.\u00a0 BUT \u2026 workplaces have a responsibility as well for keeping staff happy and healthy.\u00a0 It\u2019s good to be positive but, workplace stress is not just a personal thing, it\u2019s political too.\r\n\r\nAnd it makes sense for business \u2013 the NHS\u2019s Chief Medical Officer claimed recently that mental health issues, including workplace stress led to the loss of 70 million working days a year, costing the economy between \u00a370-100 billion annually.\r\n\r\nIn fact, employers have a statutory responsibility to ensure the health and well-being of their employees.\r\n\r\nHow does YOUR employer measure up??\r\n\r\nHere at Bluebell Therapy we offer counselling, hypnotherapy and also regular Relaxation Courses to help people to learn self-management skills.\u00a0 We also offer training packages to businesses and schools to support people being able to deal effectively with the rigors and potential stresses of a busy lifestyle.\u00a0 This includes:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Practical and emotional strategies to deal with stress<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Self-awareness exercises so that participants can focus on their own personal experiences and development.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>A relaxation session, using meditation-type techniques<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Guidance on achieving self-management techniques at home.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nTraining is offered with colleague, Kirsty Knight - collectively we are\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.salus-training.co.uk\/\">Salus Training<\/a>. Between us we have a wealth of knowledge and experience in providing training to both young people and adults.\u00a0 We currently run this programme as a three hour session but we are happy to be flexible. We are also able to offer a free demonstration of what we do to a small group of people should you require it.\r\n\r\nSounds like something that you could benefit from?\u00a0 Give your employer a nudge then and leave this blog around in an obvious place!\r\n\r\nIf you would like more details, email us at <a href=\"mailto:bluebelltherapy@gmail.com\">bluebelltherapy@gmail.com<\/a> or <a href=\"mailto:jandk.salus@gmail.com\">jandk.salus@gmail.com<\/a>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Have a good week!<\/h3>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Best wishes,<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Judith <\/strong><\/h4>",

Having put off this dreaded task for a matter of months, I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was \u2026 and so hugely relieved it was finally done that I could have danced round the living room in mad abandon. Having said all this, there are many other less pressing things that I have managed to fit in whilst covertly avoiding any contact with Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate \u2026. I have twiddled about on my facebook page, spent hours re-arranging my book shelves, tidied my desk and even managed to do a spot of decorating \u2026 all in the name of procrastination. Done properly, as any expert will tell you, you can even learn to put procrastination off until the very last minute \u2026\r\n\r\nOn a more serious note, however, real procrastination, like any self-defeating behavior, can become extremely life-limiting and can lead to people experiencing really negative emotions such as guilt, inadequacy, stress and depression.\u00a0 It\u2019s perfectly normal to have a bit of a \u2018blind spot\u2019 to a particular task but it\u2019s not emotionally healthy to procrastinate on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nSo why do people procrastinate? There are many reasons including:\r\n\u2022 Poor time management\/organizational skills\r\n\u2022 Task overload.\r\n\u2022 Anxiety about the task.\r\n\u2022 Feeling overwhelmed.\r\n\u2022 Low self-esteem and concerns about failure.\r\n\u2022 Avoidance of things which you simply don\u2019t like doing.\r\n\r\nEmotional issues like low self-esteem are more difficult to overcome than organizational skills and that\u2019s where counsellors and therapists can help \u2026. but there are lots of things that you can do yourself too \u2026\r\n\r\n\u2022 Focus on your successes to boost your confidence \u2013 you really CAN tackle that task, you really ARE up to the job!\r\n\u2022 Spend some time thinking about what approach suits you and your personality when tackling tasks\u2026 and develop strategies that suit you.\r\n\u2022 Remind yourself that, for the most part, the task is to your benefit. A university essay, for example, is all part of the degree that you chose and that will ultimately benefit you. You don\u2019t really HAVE to do it, you CHOSE to do it.\r\n\u2022 Break down the task into manageable chunks, which don\u2019t seem so scary on their own \u2026 but build up quickly so the job is done!\r\n\u2022 Accept that you have to do it and promise yourself a reward on completion.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you\u2019re still trying to decide on your New Year Resolutions..? Whatever they may be,good luck and we hope you have a fabulous, fun-filled 2016!\r\n\r\n<img class=\"  wp-image-42 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/hnybt.jpg\" alt=\"hnybt\" width=\"275\" height=\"182\" \/>\r\n\r\n<strong>Happy New Year from Bluebell Therapy!<\/strong>",

I\u2019m at work, I\u2019m picking my daughter up from an activity, I\u2019m on a course, and isn\u2019t there supposed to be a terrible earthquake happening on that day?? (which, bizarrely, wouldn\u2019t even come close, in the fear stakes, to sitting in that BIG, SCARY chair and opening my mouth wide ....)\r\n\r\nThat was me prior to undergoing some hypnotherapy a few years ago \u2013 ironically my fear of dentists led me to tactically ignoring some of those helpful texts ... and probably led to a couple of fillings which I wouldn\u2019t have needed otherwise.... because fear is restricting and immobilising, it can stop you doing sensible things (like attending dental appointments), necessary things (plane rides if you need to get somewhere) and even TASTY things, like eating cheese!\r\n\r\nMy daughter (yes, I\u2019m shamelessly exploiting family for this blog..!) had a phobia about what she described as \u2018characters\u2019 for many years \u2013 people dressed up as different characters, in sweaty costumes with hugely ill-proportioned heads. This fear, known as masklophobia, is actually quite common \u2013 largely because it\u2019s important for us to infer different things from facial expression \u2013 and can be anxiety-inducing and even slightly creepy, when that is denied to us. Appealing to the logic is not always helpful with phobias ... yes, my daughter could see that a man went into the gents with a duck costume and papier mache head under his arm and then emerged as Donald Duck ... it was clear that Donald was actually an ordinary man dressed up ..... BUT, phobias don\u2019t work like that ... they transcend the logical, the intellect, they are embedded within our sub-conscious and they don\u2019t take too lightly to being told to go away. They are rooted in a previous experience..... this initial experience is often forgotten but the feelings of terror remain. And terror is not an exaggeration for anyone who actually has a true phobia will know. Because having a phobia isn\u2019t the same as being nervous or anxious \u2013 feeling anxiety on starting a new job is a natural response to a new situation (not a phobia of offices!). Feeling petrified and immobile at the sight of a tiny house spider is a phobia \u2026 there\u2019s a difference (a bit like the difference between a headache and a blinding migraine!).\r\n<h2>So how can hypnotherapy help?<\/h2>\r\nWell hypnotherapy allows the therapist to get right into your sub-conscious and have a root around. Counselling can be great too \u2026 but sometimes you really can\u2019t remember that initial experience so it\u2019s difficult to try and \u2018unpick it\u2019 simply by talking. Hypnotherapy can use regression whereby we go back to that initial trigger and explore it, putting things into perspective and laying it to rest. I can remember where my dental phobia started \u2013 a horrible experience of four teeth taken out under gas, where I can still vividly recall a frightening dream mixed up with a close up of the dentist\u2019s nasal hair and a pair of \u2018pliers\u2019 coming towards me. Actually, to get all this in perspective, I needed those teeth out since my mouth was too full, the gas alleviated the pain and I simply had a bad dream. Simply telling me all that never worked but, under hypnosis, amazing things really can happen \u2026 your sub-conscious is much more open to suggestion, for example, and the whole episode can be \u2018re-framed\u2019 and, in effect, \u2018re-lived\u2019 \u2013 this time in a relaxed way, therefore removing the fear. This can be done by watching back a memory on a \u2018screen\u2019 \u2013 removing or reducing its emotional proximity. I was then taken through the whole process of going to the dentist, from receiving the reminder, to entering the waiting room to actually sitting in the chair with my mouth open, all the while feeling relaxed and happy \u2026 and that is now how I feel about regular check-ups. I don\u2019t LOVE going to the dentist (it would be weird if I did, right?) but I\u2019m ok with it.\r\n<img class=\"  wp-image-49 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/spider.jpg\" alt=\"spider\" width=\"232\" height=\"173\" \/>\r\n<h3>I wonder what scares you?

I\u2019m pondering this as I hear a ping, the sound of a text arriving, heralding the date of my next dental check up.  Immediately my heart begins racing and, in my head, hundreds of plausible excuses start to crowd in as to why I really can\u2019t make this appointment ... I\u2019m at work, I\u2019m picking my daughter up from an activity, I\u2019m on a course,  and isn\u2019t there supposed to be a terrible earthquake happening on that day?? (which, bizarrely, wouldn\u2019t  even come close, in the fear stakes, to sitting in that BIG, SCARY chair and opening my mouth wide ....) <\/p>\r\n<p>That was me prior to undergoing some hypnotherapy a few years ago \u2013 ironically my fear of dentists led me to tactically ignoring some of those helpful texts ... and probably led to a couple of fillings which I wouldn\u2019t have needed otherwise.... because fear is restricting and immobilising, it can stop you doing sensible things (like attending dental appointments), necessary things (plane rides if you need to get somewhere) and even TASTY things, like eating cheese! <\/p>\r\n<p>My daughter (yes, I\u2019m shamelessly exploiting family for this blog..!) had a phobia about what she described as \u2018characters\u2019 for many years \u2013 people dressed up as different characters, in sweaty costumes with hugely ill-proportioned heads.  This fear, known as masklophobia, is actually quite common \u2013 largely because it\u2019s important for us to infer different things from facial expression \u2013 and can be anxiety-inducing and even slightly creepy, when that is denied to us.  Appealing to the logic is not always helpful with phobias ... yes, my daughter could see that a man went into the gents with a duck costume and papier mache head under his arm and then emerged as Donald Duck ... it was clear that Donald was actually an ordinary man dressed up ..... BUT, phobias don\u2019t work like that ... they transcend the logical, the intellect, they are embedded within our sub-conscious and they don\u2019t take too lightly to being told to go away.  They are rooted in a previous experience..... this initial experience is often forgotten but the feelings of terror remain.  And terror is not an exaggeration for anyone who actually has a true phobia will know.  Because having a phobia isn\u2019t the same as being nervous or anxious \u2013 feeling anxiety on starting a new job is a natural response to a new situation (not a phobia of offices!).  Feeling petrified and immobile at the sight of a tiny house spider is a phobia \u2026 there\u2019s a difference (a bit like the difference between a headache and a blinding migraine!). <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>So how can hypnotherapy help?  <\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Well hypnotherapy allows the therapist to get right into your sub-conscious and have a root around.  Counselling can be great too \u2026 but sometimes you really can\u2019t remember that initial experience so it\u2019s difficult to try and \u2018unpick it\u2019 simply by talking.  Hypnotherapy can use regression whereby we go back to that initial trigger and explore it, putting things into perspective and laying it to rest.  I can remember where my dental phobia started \u2013 a horrible experience of four teeth taken out under gas, where I can still vividly recall a frightening dream mixed up with a close up of the dentist\u2019s nasal hair and a pair of \u2018pliers\u2019 coming towards me.  Actually, to get all this in perspective, I needed those teeth out since my mouth was too full, the gas alleviated the pain and I simply had a bad dream.  Simply telling me all that never worked but, under hypnosis, amazing things really can happen \u2026 your sub-conscious is much more open to suggestion, for example, and the whole episode can be \u2018re-framed\u2019 and, in effect, \u2018re-lived\u2019 \u2013 this time in a relaxed way, therefore removing the fear. This can be done by watching back a memory on a \u2018screen\u2019 \u2013 removing or reducing its emotional proximity.

I\u2019m pondering this as I hear a ping, the sound of a text arriving, heralding the date of my next dental check up. Immediately my heart begins racing and, in my head, hundreds of plausible excuses start to crowd in as to why I really can\u2019t make this appointment ... I\u2019m at work, I\u2019m picking my daughter up from an activity, I\u2019m on a course, and isn\u2019t there supposed to be a terrible earthquake happening on that day?? (which, bizarrely, wouldn\u2019t even come close, in the fear stakes, to sitting in that BIG, SCARY chair and opening my mouth wide ....)\r\n\r\nThat was me prior to undergoing some hypnotherapy a few years ago \u2013 ironically my fear of dentists led me to tactically ignoring some of those helpful texts ... and probably led to a couple of fillings which I wouldn\u2019t have needed otherwise.... because fear is restricting and immobilising, it can stop you doing sensible things (like attending dental appointments), necessary things (plane rides if you need to get somewhere) and even TASTY things, like eating cheese!\r\n\r\nMy daughter (yes, I\u2019m shamelessly exploiting family for this blog..!) had a phobia about what she described as \u2018characters\u2019 for many years \u2013 people dressed up as different characters, in sweaty costumes with hugely ill-proportioned heads. This fear, known as masklophobia, is actually quite common \u2013 largely because it\u2019s important for us to infer different things from facial expression \u2013 and can be anxiety-inducing and even slightly creepy, when that is denied to us. Appealing to the logic is not always helpful with phobias ... yes, my daughter could see that a man went into the gents with a duck costume and papier mache head under his arm and then emerged as Donald Duck ... it was clear that Donald was actually an ordinary man dressed up ..... BUT, phobias don\u2019t work like that ... they transcend the logical, the intellect, they are embedded within our sub-conscious and they don\u2019t take too lightly to being told to go away. They are rooted in a previous experience..... this initial experience is often forgotten but the feelings of terror remain. And terror is not an exaggeration for anyone who actually has a true phobia will know. Because having a phobia isn\u2019t the same as being nervous or anxious \u2013 feeling anxiety on starting a new job is a natural response to a new situation (not a phobia of offices!). Feeling petrified and immobile at the sight of a tiny house spider is a phobia \u2026 there\u2019s a difference (a bit like the difference between a headache and a blinding migraine!).\r\n<h2>So how can hypnotherapy help?<\/h2>\r\nWell hypnotherapy allows the therapist to get right into your sub-conscious and have a root around. Counselling can be great too \u2026 but sometimes you really can\u2019t remember that initial experience so it\u2019s difficult to try and \u2018unpick it\u2019 simply by talking. Hypnotherapy can use regression whereby we go back to that initial trigger and explore it, putting things into perspective and laying it to rest. I can remember where my dental phobia started \u2013 a horrible experience of four teeth taken out under gas, where I can still vividly recall a frightening dream mixed up with a close up of the dentist\u2019s nasal hair and a pair of \u2018pliers\u2019 coming towards me. Actually, to get all this in perspective, I needed those teeth out since my mouth was too full, the gas alleviated the pain and I simply had a bad dream. Simply telling me all that never worked but, under hypnosis, amazing things really can happen \u2026 your sub-conscious is much more open to suggestion, for example, and the whole episode can be \u2018re-framed\u2019 and, in effect, \u2018re-lived\u2019 \u2013 this time in a relaxed way, therefore removing the fear. This can be done by watching back a memory on a \u2018screen\u2019 \u2013 removing or reducing its emotional proximity. I was then taken through the whole process of going to the dentist, from receiving the reminder, to entering the waiting room to actually sitting in the chair with my mouth open, all the while feeling relaxed and happy \u2026 and that is now how I feel about regular check-ups. I don\u2019t LOVE going to the dentist (it would be weird if I did, right?) but I\u2019m ok with it.\r\n<img class=\"  wp-image-49 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/spider.jpg\" alt=\"spider\" width=\"232\" height=\"173\" \/>\r\n<h3>I wonder what scares you?

But for students, whether they\u2019re doing GCSEs, \u2018A\u2019 Levels or university exams, the warmer weather can only mean one thing \u2026. Exams!\u00a0 Nobody likes them, many people hate them and they are the cause of major stress among young people.\u00a0\u00a0 And with the \u2018testing culture\u2019 ever more entrenched in primary schools too, the pressure is even greater.\r\n<h2>So what\u2019s the answer?<\/h2>\r\nUnfortunately exams aren\u2019t going away anytime soon but there ARE things that you can do to make life a bit easier for yourself around exam time.\r\n\r\nHere are 8 ways to reduce exam stress:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Plan ahead! <\/strong>You\u2019re never going to cram a couple of years\u2019 worth of notes into your brain the night before the exam \u2013 it\u2019s just not possible! The best way to revise is to make yourself a timetable, which sets out when you\u2019re revising each subject and also includes free time, doing stuff that you enjoy. Just like you can\u2019t cram in everything in one night, you also can\u2019t spend every minute of every day working. Balance is the key!<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Remember that you are an individual. <\/strong>Work out the best times, places and ways for YOU to revise \u2026 your preferences may be completely different from your friend\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s fine as long as it works for YOU!<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Keep your energy levels up by eating well.<\/strong>Olympic athletes can\u2019t perform on a can of Coke and a Curly-Wurly .... and you will be doing the brain equivalent of running a marathon, which means you need to be on top form!<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Exercise and fresh air really does do you good! <\/strong>A change of scene and a walk round the park or (my personal favourite) a bit of salsa dancing or Zumba really does re-charge your batteries and helps with a healthy dose of perspective \u2026. Exams ARE important but you have a life too!<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Yes, you do have time to sleep \u2026! <\/strong>In fact it\u2019s essential if you don\u2019t want to find you\u2019re falling asleep in the middle of a quadratic equation or a history essay.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Talk it through. <\/strong>You may feel that you are alone in feeling stressed about exams but around 700,000 students take their GCSEs every Summer \u2013 that represents an awful lot of adrenaline, fear and anxiety. Talking helps \u2013 with friends, parents, teachers, school counsellors.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Watch out for symptoms of stress \u2026 <\/strong> get to know yourself and your own triggers. Start to watch out for stress-related symptoms in your own body \u2013 they may be headaches, tummy aches, breathlessness \u2013 everyone is different so you need to learn to know when you\u2019re getting stressed so that you can take some time out and relax.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Treat yourself .. because you deserve it! <\/strong>Do nice things, go out, pamper yourself, acknowledge that exams are hard and you are a superstar for working hard and getting on with it.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/chairs.jpg\"><img class=\"  wp-image-63 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/chairs.jpg\" alt=\"chairs\" width=\"279\" height=\"209\" \/><\/a>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Lastly, remember that worry is not a productive emotion. You CAN do something to help your performance in exams beforehand\u2026.but once you\u2019ve taken them, move on and enjoy your Summer. Worrying won\u2019t affect your results one way or the other!

Start to watch out for stress-related symptoms in your own body \u2013 they may be headaches, tummy aches, breathlessness \u2013 everyone is different so you need to learn to know when you\u2019re getting stressed so that you can take some time out and relax.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Treat yourself .. because you deserve it! <\/strong>Do nice things, go out, pamper yourself, acknowledge that exams are hard and you are a superstar for working hard and getting on with it.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/chairs.jpg\"><img class=\"  wp-image-63 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/chairs.jpg\" alt=\"chairs\" width=\"279\" height=\"209\" \/><\/a>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Lastly, remember that worry is not a productive emotion.

    "post_content": "&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPhobias all have one big thing in common \u2013 fear. I\u2019m pondering this as I hear a ping, the sound of a text arriving, heralding the date of my next dental check up. Immediately my heart begins racing and, in my head, hundreds of plausible excuses start to crowd in as to why I really can\u2019t make this appointment ... I\u2019m at work, I\u2019m picking my daughter up from an activity, I\u2019m on a course, and isn\u2019t there supposed to be a terrible earthquake happening on that day?? (which, bizarrely, wouldn\u2019t even come close, in the fear stakes, to sitting in that BIG, SCARY chair and opening my mouth wide ....)\r\n\r\nThat was me prior to undergoing some hypnotherapy a few years ago \u2013 ironically my fear of dentists led me to tactically ignoring some of those helpful texts ... and probably led to a couple of fillings which I wouldn\u2019t have needed otherwise.... because fear is restricting and immobilising, it can stop you doing sensible things (like attending dental appointments), necessary things (plane rides if you need to get somewhere) and even TASTY things, like eating cheese!\r\n\r\nMy daughter (yes, I\u2019m shamelessly exploiting family for this blog..!) had a phobia about what she described as \u2018characters\u2019 for many years \u2013 people dressed up as different characters, in sweaty costumes with hugely ill-proportioned heads. This fear, known as masklophobia, is actually quite common \u2013 largely because it\u2019s important for us to infer different things from facial expression \u2013 and can be anxiety-inducing and even slightly creepy, when that is denied to us. Appealing to the logic is not always helpful with phobias ... yes, my daughter could see that a man went into the gents with a duck costume and papier mache head under his arm and then emerged as Donald Duck ... it was clear that Donald was actually an ordinary man dressed up ..... BUT, phobias don\u2019t work like that ... they transcend the logical, the intellect, they are embedded within our sub-conscious and they don\u2019t take too lightly to being told to go away. They are rooted in a previous experience..... this initial experience is often forgotten but the feelings of terror remain. And terror is not an exaggeration for anyone who actually has a true phobia will know. Because having a phobia isn\u2019t the same as being nervous or anxious \u2013 feeling anxiety on starting a new job is a natural response to a new situation (not a phobia of offices!). Feeling petrified and immobile at the sight of a tiny house spider is a phobia \u2026 there\u2019s a difference (a bit like the difference between a headache and a blinding migraine!).\r\n<h2>So how can hypnotherapy help?<\/h2>\r\nWell hypnotherapy allows the therapist to get right into your sub-conscious and have a root around. Counselling can be great too \u2026 but sometimes you really can\u2019t remember that initial experience so it\u2019s difficult to try and \u2018unpick it\u2019 simply by talking. Hypnotherapy can use regression whereby we go back to that initial trigger and explore it, putting things into perspective and laying it to rest. I can remember where my dental phobia started \u2013 a horrible experience of four teeth taken out under gas, where I can still vividly recall a frightening dream mixed up with a close up of the dentist\u2019s nasal hair and a pair of \u2018pliers\u2019 coming towards me. Actually, to get all this in perspective, I needed those teeth out since my mouth was too full, the gas alleviated the pain and I simply had a bad dream. Simply telling me all that never worked but, under hypnosis, amazing things really can happen \u2026 your sub-conscious is much more open to suggestion, for example, and the whole episode can be \u2018re-framed\u2019 and, in effect, \u2018re-lived\u2019 \u2013 this time in a relaxed way, therefore removing the fear. This can be done by watching back a memory on a \u2018screen\u2019 \u2013 removing or reducing its emotional proximity. I was then taken through the whole process of going to the dentist, from receiving the reminder, to entering the waiting room to actually sitting in the chair with my mouth open, all the while feeling relaxed and happy \u2026 and that is now how I feel about regular check-ups. I don\u2019t LOVE going to the dentist (it would be weird if I did, right?) but I\u2019m ok with it.\r\n<img class=\"  wp-image-49 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/spider.jpg\" alt=\"spider\" width=\"232\" height=\"173\" \/>\r\n<h3>I wonder what scares you?

Simply telling me all that never worked but, under hypnosis, amazing things really can happen \u2026 your sub-conscious is much more open to suggestion, for example, and the whole episode can be \u2018re-framed\u2019 and, in effect, \u2018re-lived\u2019 \u2013 this time in a relaxed way, therefore removing the fear. This can be done by watching back a memory on a \u2018screen\u2019 \u2013 removing or reducing its emotional proximity. I was then taken through the whole process of going to the dentist, from receiving the reminder, to entering the waiting room to actually sitting in the chair with my mouth open, all the while feeling relaxed and happy \u2026 and that is now how I feel about regular check-ups. I don\u2019t LOVE going to the dentist (it would be weird if I did, right?) but I\u2019m ok with it.\r\n<img class=\"  wp-image-49 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/spider.jpg\" alt=\"spider\" width=\"232\" height=\"173\" \/>\r\n<h3>I wonder what scares you?

    "post_content": "I\u2019m a counsellor and hypnotherapist and probably do an equal amount of both. However, in terms of curiosity, the focus is firmly on the latter. Just what is hypnotherapy? How does it work? What does it feel like? Does it mean that you lose control? (the sub-text of this: Will you make me cluck like a chicken? !!) \u2026.\r\n\r\nSo, I\u2019m going to try to cover all bases \u2013 but please comment at the end if you have unanswered questions and I\u2019ll do my best to get back to you.\r\n<h3>F.A.Qs:<\/h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>What is hypnotherapy?Hypnotherapy is a type of psychological therapy which utilizes hypnosis. This process alters our state of consciousness in a way that represses the conscious part of the mind while also revealing or stimulating the subconscious part. This part is susceptible to positive suggestion, which can bring about meaningful change to thoughts, feelings and behaviours. A qualified hypnotherapist is able to use suggestion in an appropriate way to facilitate this change.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>How does hypnotherapy feel?Hypnotherapy feels really relaxing. Different people, however, report slightly different sensations \u2013 clients have described it as \u2018floating in my own head\u2019 for example, \u2018drifting\u2019 and so on. Whatever, your experience, it\u2019s comfortable and pleasant! Many people also experience time distortion, where a 40 minute session can seem like 5 or 10.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Will I fall asleep?The hypnotic trance is not the same as being asleep. However, you will probably feel detached from everyday life, perhaps in a bit of a bubble. When I\u2019m hypnotized, I\u2019ve sometimes felt like I\u2019m in that \u2018space\u2019 between waking and sleeping \u2013 completely aware of what is going on but reluctant to emerge back into normal life. It\u2019s a lovely, relaxing feeling \u2013 you\u2019ll love it!<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Can I be made to do something I don\u2019t want to?You are in control at all times. Stage hypnosis works on the principle that the participants want to engage in extrovert behaviour \u2013 you don\u2019t volunteer for a stage show unless you are willing to make a bit of a fool of yourself. In a hypnotherapy session, you cannot be made to do something that you don\u2019t want to. Moreover, the therapeutic relationship is one of trust and you and the therapist will have discussed your goals for treatment in depth.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Can everyone be hypnotized?Everyone can be hypnotized if they want to be \u2013 if you go for treatment, you need to be able to relax into it. Clients are sometimes nervous the first time but a good therapist should explain the process to you so that any fears are allayed.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>What issues can hypnotherapy be used for?Hypnotherapy is a fantastic type of therapy for lots of different issues including anxiety and stress-related issues, phobias, weight loss, stopping smoking, habit-type behaviours and even pain management. I treat lots of people for anxiety with hypnotherapy and get great results.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>How many sessions of hypnotherapy will I need?This is a really difficult question to answer because everyone is different. So, for example, for a habit like nail biting, one person may stop after 1 session while others may take 3. For deep-seated issues such as anxiety, I usually think that 4 is the magic number but again it\u2019s personal and you need to talk to your therapist about it.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>How successful is hypnotherapy as a treatment?It\u2019s very successful \u2013 I see the positive effects of hypnotherapy regularly and it\u2019s amazing to see people who now feel liberated as a result of treatment. Of course, it\u2019s not a \u2018miracle cure\u2019 and you need to work with it \u2013 just like any other form of treatment.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nThere are probably loads more questions that I could cover! If you have a specific one that you would like me to answer, please comment and leave your email address and I\u2019ll get back to you.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\n\r\nJudith\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/logo.jpg\"><img class=\"  wp-image-64 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/logo.jpg\" alt=\"logo\" width=\"88\" height=\"88\" \/><\/a>",

However, in terms of curiosity, the focus is firmly on the latter. Just what is hypnotherapy? How does it work? What does it feel like? Does it mean that you lose control? (the sub-text of this: Will you make me cluck like a chicken? !!) \u2026.\n\nSo, I\u2019m going to try to cover all bases \u2013 but please comment at the end if you have unanswered questions and I\u2019ll do my best to get back to you.\n<h3>F.A.Qs:<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<ol>\n\t<li>What is hypnotherapy?\nHypnotherapy is a type of psychological therapy which utilizes hypnosis. This process alters our state of consciousness in a way that represses the conscious part of the mind while also revealing or stimulating the subconscious part. This part is susceptible to positive suggestion, which can bring about meaningful change to thoughts, feelings and behaviours. A qualified hypnotherapist is able to use suggestion in an appropriate way to facilitate this change.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ol>\n<ol>\n\t<li>How does hypnotherapy feel?\nHypnotherapy feels really relaxing. Different people, however, report slightly different sensations \u2013 clients have described it as \u2018floating in my own head\u2019 for example, \u2018drifting\u2019 and so on. Whatever, your experience, it\u2019s comfortable and pleasant! Many people also experience time distortion, where a 40 minute session can seem like 5 or 10.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ol>\n<ol>\n\t<li>Will I fall asleep?\nThe hypnotic trance is not the same as being asleep. However, you will probably feel detached from everyday life, perhaps in a bit of a bubble. When I\u2019m hypnotized, I\u2019ve sometimes felt like I\u2019m in that \u2018space\u2019 between waking and sleeping \u2013 completely aware of what is going on but reluctant to emerge back into normal life. It\u2019s a lovely, relaxing feeling \u2013 you\u2019ll love it!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ol>\n<ol>\n\t<li>Can I be made to do something I don\u2019t want to?\nYou are in control at all times. Stage hypnosis works on the principle that the participants want to engage in extrovert behaviour \u2013 you don\u2019t volunteer for a stage show unless you are willing to make a bit of a fool of yourself. In a hypnotherapy session, you cannot be made to do something that you don\u2019t want to. Moreover, the therapeutic relationship is one of trust and you and the therapist will have discussed your goals for treatment in depth.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ol>\n<ol>\n\t<li>Can everyone be hypnotized?\nEveryone can be hypnotized if they want to be \u2013 if you go for treatment, you need to be able to relax into it. Clients are sometimes nervous the first time but a good therapist should explain the process to you so that any fears are allayed.&lt;br&gt;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ol>\n<ol>\n\t<li>What issues can hypnotherapy be used for?\nHypnotherapy is a fantastic type of therapy for lots of different issues including anxiety and stress-related issues, phobias, weight loss, stopping smoking, habit-type behaviours and even pain management. I treat lots of people for anxiety with hypnotherapy and get great results.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ol>\n<ol>\n\t<li>How many sessions of hypnotherapy will I need?\nThis is a really difficult question to answer because everyone is different. So, for example, for a habit like nail biting, one person may stop after 1 session while others may take 3. For deep-seated issues such as anxiety, I usually think that 4 is the magic number but again it\u2019s personal and you need to talk to your therapist about it.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ol>\n<ol>\n\t<li>How successful is hypnotherapy as a treatment?\nIt\u2019s very successful \u2013 I see the positive effects of hypnotherapy regularly and it\u2019s amazing to see people who now feel liberated as a result of treatment.

I had a panic attack on a bus once, and before I knew it, I was getting up and running to the front of the bus to get off \u2013 without even consciously thinking it through and miles away from my normal stop.\r\n\r\nA therapist can help you find the causes of your anxieties (that\u2019s important) but, in the meantime, <strong>Grounding<\/strong> or the <strong>54321 approach<\/strong> can help you deal with a panic attack when it happens:\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Look around you<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/panic-woman.jpg\"><img class=\"  wp-image-95 alignright\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/panic-woman.jpg\" alt=\"panic-woman\" width=\"97\" height=\"148\" \/><\/a><\/li>\r\n\t<li>Find 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell and 1 thing you can taste.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Panic attacks can often make you feel like you are disconnected to your surroundings and have lost all control \u2013 doing this can help you to gain that connection back and help to distract you too.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\n<i>Judith, Bluebell Therapy<\/i>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/logo.jpg\"><img class=\"  wp-image-64 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/logo.jpg\" alt=\"logo\" width=\"111\" height=\"111\" \/><\/a>",

When you feel anxious about everyday life, your world really does reduce in size. It\u2019s difficult to embark on new adventures and experiences, when you are struck down with nerves just at the thought of catching a bus or bumping into someone you know on the street.\u00a0Many people can actually be afraid of anxiety itself; if you have ever had a panic attack, for example, you will have experienced first-hand that horrible feeling of imminent death or doom, accompanied by physical symptoms which are similar to those of heart attacks. And, if you have been there, chances are you never want to go there again. There\u2019s no doubt that anxiety can be frightening and threatening.\r\n\r\nWhat isn\u2019t mentioned so much, is that anxiety also affects family and friends \u2013 who want to help but often just don\u2019t know how to.\r\n<h2>The \u2018Just snap out of it\u2019 mentality is clearly NOT helpful \u2026 so what is?<\/h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Be a listening ear for your partner or friend. Some people like to share their feelings, others don\u2019t. Being there for someone doesn\u2019t mean badgering them to off load if they don\u2019t want to! But if you make it clear that you are there if they need you, that you won\u2019t judge them and that your opinion of them won\u2019t change \u2026 then that is worth so much to someone. Don\u2019t assume that they know they can come to you \u2013 spell it out and then leave it up to them.<img class=\"  wp-image-107 alignright\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/pink.jpg\" alt=\"pink\" width=\"173\" height=\"116\" \/><\/li>\r\n\t<li>Spend quality time with them\u2026 just being there, being a friend is often enough.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Be available \u2026 knowing someone is just a phone call away is a comfort.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Encourag<img class=\"  wp-image-106 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/running.jpg\" alt=\"running\" width=\"169\" height=\"112\" \/>e new activities and experiences. Someone with anxiety is more likely to try new things with a trusted friend or partner. Exercise is a great way to alleviate anxiety \u2013 and you\u2019re more likely to stick to it if you do it with someone else.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Express pride at small steps \u2013 emphasise the positive rather than criticising avoidance or irrational fears and behaviours.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Never judge.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Don\u2019t assume you know what someone needs \u2013 offer help and listen to what they want, rather than simply doing what you think they need.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Don\u2019t pretend to understand how anxiety or panic attacks feel if you have never experienced them. Being genuine is key to helping someone. In the same way, try not to become frustrated \u2026 but, if you do lose your temper one day, it\u2019s not the end of the world if you have an open conversation about how you are feeling too. You\u2019re only human.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Encourage treatment but don\u2019t push.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Ask for help and support yourself if you need it. There are some great support groups out there for carers and family of people who are facing mental health challenges. You\u2019re a good friend or partner BUT you\u2019re not a nurse \u2013 you have needs too. Don\u2019t let your friendship become too one-sided.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/faces.jpg\"><img class=\"  wp-image-105 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/faces.jpg\" alt=\"faces\" width=\"211\" height=\"226\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nYour help and support is so important to someone with anxiety \u2013 just being there, being a friend makes all the difference!\r\n\r\nGood luck,\r\n\r\nJudith\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/logo.jpg\"><img class=\"  wp-image-64 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/logo.jpg\" alt=\"logo\" width=\"88\" height=\"88\" \/><\/a>",

When you feel anxious about everyday life, your world really does reduce in size. It\u2019s difficult to embark on new adventures and experiences, when you are struck down with nerves just at the thought of catching a bus or bumping into someone you know on the street.\u00a0Many people can actually be afraid of anxiety itself; if you have ever had a panic attack, for example, you will have experienced first-hand that horrible feeling of imminent death or doom, accompanied by physical symptoms which are similar to those of heart attacks. And, if you have been there, chances are you never want to go there again. There\u2019s no doubt that anxiety can be frightening and threatening.\r\n\r\nWhat isn\u2019t mentioned so much, is that anxiety also affects family and friends \u2013 who want to help but often just don\u2019t know how to.\r\n<h2>The \u2018Just snap out of it\u2019 mentality is clearly NOT helpful \u2026 so what is?<\/h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Be a listening ear for your partner or friend. Some people like to share their feelings, others don\u2019t. Being there for someone doesn\u2019t mean badgering them to off load if they don\u2019t want to! But if you make it clear that you are there if they need you, that you won\u2019t judge them and that your opinion of them won\u2019t change \u2026 then that is worth so much to someone. Don\u2019t assume that they know they can come to you \u2013 spell it out and then leave it up to them.<img class=\"  wp-image-107 alignright\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/pink.jpg\" alt=\"pink\" width=\"173\" height=\"116\" \/><\/li>\r\n\t<li>Spend quality time with them\u2026 just being there, being a friend is often enough.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Be available \u2026 knowing someone is just a phone call away is a comfort.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Encourag<img class=\"  wp-image-106 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/running.jpg\" alt=\"running\" width=\"169\" height=\"112\" \/>e new activities and experiences. Someone with anxiety is more likely to try new things with a trusted friend or partner. Exercise is a great way to alleviate anxiety \u2013 and you\u2019re more likely to stick to it if you do it with someone else.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Express pride at small steps \u2013 emphasise the positive rather than criticising avoidance or irrational fears and behaviours.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Never judge.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Don\u2019t assume you know what someone needs \u2013 offer help and listen to what they want, rather than simply doing what you think they need.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Don\u2019t pretend to understand how anxiety or panic attacks feel if you have never experienced them. Being genuine is key to helping someone. In the same way, try not to become frustrated \u2026 but, if you do lose your temper one day, it\u2019s not the end of the world if you have an open conversation about how you are feeling too. You\u2019re only human.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Encourage treatment but don\u2019t push.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Ask for help and support yourself if you need it. There are some great support groups out there for carers and family of people who are facing mental health challenges. You\u2019re a good friend or partner BUT you\u2019re not a nurse \u2013 you have needs too. Don\u2019t let your friendship become too one-sided.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/faces.jpg\"><img class=\"  wp-image-105 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/faces.jpg\" alt=\"faces\" width=\"211\" height=\"226\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nYour help and support is so important to someone with anxiety \u2013 just being there, being a friend makes all the difference!\r\n\r\nGood luck,\r\n\r\nJudith\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/logo.jpg\"><img class=\"  wp-image-64 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/logo.jpg\" alt=\"logo\" width=\"88\" height=\"88\" \/><\/a>",

Social situations ARE sometimes awkward and scary! Why? Well, because you\u2019re opening yourself up to new experiences which you\u2019re not sure about, new people who you don\u2019t know and \u2018exposing\u2019 yourself to judgement (good or bad). In fact, most people are a bit nervous about going to a party with lots of new people\u2026 I know I am.

Once you start to realise that you CAN overcome a fear, that there is the opportunity for positive experiences, the fear subsides.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/happy.jpg\"><img class=\"  wp-image-114 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/happy.jpg\" alt=\"happy\" width=\"335\" height=\"221\" \/><\/a>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Good Luck!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Best wishes,<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Judith\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/logo.jpg\"><img class=\"  wp-image-64 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/logo.jpg\" alt=\"logo\" width=\"98\" height=\"98\" \/><\/a><\/p>",

    "post_content": "Firstly, it\u2019s useful to define what a phobia actually is \u2026 the NHS Choices website defines phobias as \u2018an overwhelming and debilitating fear of an object, place, situation, feeling or animal.\u201d It is more extreme than fear in the normal everyday sense and develops when a person has an exaggerated or irrational perception of danger or threat about a situation or object. So, for example, being a bit wary of spiders isn\u2019t the same as being arachnophobic. Phobias aren\u2019t always entirely irrational \u2013 in the sense that some spiders, for example, ARE dangerous and should be avoided. But a phobia will assume that ALL spiders \u2013 even a tiny house spider \u2013 is a threat.\r\n<h2>So what are the 5 most common?

If you don\u2019t know, then have a play with different things.\r\n\r\nHere are a few ideas:\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/sqeeze.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-136 alignright\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/sqeeze.jpg\" alt=\"sqeeze\" width=\"87\" height=\"117\" \/><\/a>\u2022 Stress balls (there are lots of different ones \u2013 have a play!)\r\n\u2022 Puzzles\/wordsearches\/cards are a great distraction if you\r\nenjoy them\r\n\u2022 A journal to write down your feelings \u2013 it can help to\r\nexpress yourself (and nobody else will see it!)\r\n\u2022 Music which soothes you \u2013 some people want relaxing meditation-type music, others want to dance!\r\n\u2022 If you get stress-headaches (like I do), include some cooling strips for your head\r\n\u2022 Re-connecting with your senses can help \u2013 so include something which appeals to each one of your senses\r\n\u2022 It can be calming to have a lovely smooth stone or crystal to hold and touch\r\n\u2022 For children, I would include some bubble mixture \u2013 to <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/bubbles.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-138\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/bubbles.jpg\" alt=\"bubbles\" width=\"170\" height=\"109\" \/><\/a>blow a really big bubble, you need to really slow your breathing down. It\u2019s quite relaxing as an adult too!\r\n\u2022 Colouring is now an acceptable and enjoyable adult activity! A good colouring book and some felt tips are a must for me \u2013 see if they work for you too.\r\n\r\nYou can find some really lovely free downloadable colouring sheets for adults using the following link:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.wayfair.co.uk\/ideas-and-advice\/trendspotting-colouring-pages-for-adults-S9796.html\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.wayfair.co.uk\/ideas-and-advice\/trendspotting-colouring-pages-for-adults-S9796.html<\/a>\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\n\r\nJudith\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/logo.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-64 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/logo.jpg\" alt=\"logo\" width=\"89\" height=\"89\" \/><\/a>",

If YOU suffer from anxiety, then you know that it\u2019s not always easy to deal with everyday life when you feel panicky and overwhelmed. There are some steps that you can take, however, which will help to calm things down for you \u2026 because anxiety is NOT a life sentence.\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Recognise your OWN signs that anxiety is creeping up. Notice where you feel your stress and anxiety physically. I know I\u2019m tired and anxious when I get headaches \u2013the onset of a bad head is now my reminder to slow things down, to try to see things in another way, to go out for a walk or start looking after myself more.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Notice when things are good too \u2013 reflect on WHY you feel better or differently. What has happened to make this change? Is it something that you can do again? Actually MAKE changes \u2013 rather than allowing them tohappen to you. It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 but if you keep doing the same old things, don\u2019t be surprised that you have the same old life. Only you can change things for the better. Take control.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/masks.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-177 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/masks.jpg\" alt=\"masks\" width=\"228\" height=\"174\" \/><\/a>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Breathe \u2026 deep, slow breathing has the natural effect of calming everything down. Get into the habit of breathing through anxietyusing deep, abdominal breathing (or \u2018belly breathing\u2019) \u2013 naturally eliciting the physiological relaxation response in our minds and bodies. Anxious breathing is not productive \u2013 that rapid, shallow breathing is designed as a short term \u2018fight or flight\u2019 response. Start to NOTICE when you are breathing like this \u2013 then you can put your anxiety in reverse by deep belly breathing. It sounds simple \u2013 and it is \u2013 but it WILL make a difference if you persevere<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Make time for fun and relaxation \u2013 not just as a response to feeling anxious but every day. Relaxation isn\u2019t something you should do when you\u2019re so frazzled you can\u2019t think straight \u2013 it\u2019s something that needs to be part of your everyday routine. It simply means that setting some time aside for things that you enjoy and that nourish you in some way. They don\u2019t have to be \u2018worthy\u2019 activities \u2013 relaxation is not about what you \u2018should\u2019 be doing but what you actually WANT to do. Life is full of \u2018shoulds\u2019 \u2013 relaxation is all about \u2018wants\u2019 and \u2018needs\u2019. Life is so much more manageable when you have some time to yourself, filled with things to look forward to. Give it some thought \u2013 what would really feed your soul?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Harness the power of nature \u2013 getting out for a walk (or a run) is a great way to alleviate anxiety, clear your mind and get things into perspective. It doesn\u2019t solve all your problems but it does give\u00a0you the opportunity to take some time out \u2013 even if it\u2019s just for a ten minute stroll round the park. And as we go into Spring, hopefully there\u2019ll be some sun, helping your brain to release serotonin, associated with boosting mood and helping you to feel calm and focused.Sunshine really is nature\u2019s own anti-depressant.<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/sunflower.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-178 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/sunflower.jpg\" alt=\"sunflower\" width=\"240\" height=\"148\" \/><\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nf you need extra help managing your anxiety,please get in touch.

    "post_content": "<h3><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/breath.png\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-186\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/breath.png\" alt=\"breath\" width=\"301\" height=\"191\" \/><\/a><\/strong><strong>What is \u201ccalm breathing\u201d?<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nCalm breathing is a technique that teaches your child to slow down his or her breathing when feeling stressed or anxious.\r\n\r\nWhen we are anxious, we tend to take short, quick, shallow breaths or even hyperventilate. This type of anxious breathing can make anxiety even worse. Doing calm breathing can help lower your child\u2019s anxiety, and give him or her a sense of control \u2026 and of course, it\u2019s something that your child can do by themselves when you\u2019re not around to help and support them. It really is a \u2018portable\u2019 tool and no one knows that you\u2019re doing it. This is often very important for children and young people because they don\u2019t want to be seen as different or needing special help in any way.\r\n<h3>How to help your child master the technique:<\/h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Explain why calm breathing is a good \u2018trick\u2019 to learn. You can explain, for example, that taking short quick breaths actually increases other feelings of anxiety (e.g. heart racing, dizziness, or headaches) \u2026 and conversely, slow breathing helps to automatically calm you down.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Teach the calm breathing technique: Take a slow breath in through the nose (for about 4 seconds) Hold your breath for 1 or 2 seconds Exhale slowly through the mouth (over about 4 seconds) Wait 2-3 seconds before taking another breath (5-7 seconds for teenagers) Repeat for at least 5 to 10 breaths<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/bubble.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-187 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/bubble.jpg\" alt=\"bubble\" width=\"200\" height=\"128\" \/><\/a>\u2018Bubble blowing\u2019 <\/strong>is a great way to practice some of this and there it\u2019s fun! You have to take a slow, deep breath to make a big bubble, and you have to blow the bubble really slowly or it will pop. Practise doing that with your child. Take a slow, deep breath in, hold it for a second, and then slowly blow some bubbles, the challenge being to make the bubbles as big as possible \u2013 that takes control!\r\n\r\n<strong>For Older Children and Teens: <\/strong>Since calm breathing involves taking slow, controlled breaths from the diaphragm, another way to explain this technique is to present it as <strong>\u201cbelly breathing\u201d<\/strong>. The steps for this exercise are as follows: Inhale slowly for 4 seconds through the nose. Ask your child to pretend that he or she is blowing up a balloon in the belly, so your child\u2019s belly should inflate when inhaling. Wait 2 seconds, and then slowly exhale through the mouth. Ask your child to pretend that he or she is emptying the balloon of air, so the tummy should deflate. Wait 2 seconds, and then repeat. <strong>Helpful Hint:<\/strong> When belly breathing, make sure your child\u2019s upper body (shoulders and chest area) is fairly relaxed and still. Only the belly should be moving! Step 3: Practice, practice, practice! In order for your child to be able to use this new tool effectively, he or she first needs to be an expert at calm breathing.\r\n<h3>Rules of practice:<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/practice.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-188 alignright\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/practice.jpg\" alt=\"practice\" width=\"229\" height=\"197\" \/><\/a><\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Practice a couple of times a day, doing 10 calm breaths in a row.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Practice when you\u2019re both feeling relaxed (if you\u2019re doing it together)<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Once your child is really comfortable with the technique, they can start to use it in more anxious or stressful situations<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>It\u2019s a skill \u2013 it needs to be learned and practiced if it is going to be useful!<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nGood Luck,\r\n\r\nJudith\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/\">www.bluebell-therapy.co.uk<\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/logo.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-64 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/logo.jpg\" alt=\"logo\" width=\"104\" height=\"104\" \/><\/a>",

This type of anxious breathing can make anxiety even worse. Doing calm breathing can help lower your child\u2019s anxiety, and give him or her a sense of control \u2026 and of course, it\u2019s something that your child can do by themselves when you\u2019re not around to help and support them. It really is a \u2018portable\u2019 tool and no one knows that you\u2019re doing it. This is often very important for children and young people because they don\u2019t want to be seen as different or needing special help in any way.\r\n<h3>How to help your child master the technique:<\/h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Explain why calm breathing is a good \u2018trick\u2019 to learn. You can explain, for example, that taking short quick breaths actually increases other feelings of anxiety (e.g. heart racing, dizziness, or headaches) \u2026 and conversely, slow breathing helps to automatically calm you down.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Teach the calm breathing technique: Take a slow breath in through the nose (for about 4 seconds) Hold your breath for 1 or 2 seconds Exhale slowly through the mouth (over about 4 seconds) Wait 2-3 seconds before taking another breath (5-7 seconds for teenagers) Repeat for at least 5 to 10 breaths<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/bubble.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-187 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/bubble.jpg\" alt=\"bubble\" width=\"200\" height=\"128\" \/><\/a>\u2018Bubble blowing\u2019 <\/strong>is a great way to practice some of this and there it\u2019s fun! You have to take a slow, deep breath to make a big bubble, and you have to blow the bubble really slowly or it will pop. Practise doing that with your child. Take a slow, deep breath in, hold it for a second, and then slowly blow some bubbles, the challenge being to make the bubbles as big as possible \u2013 that takes control!\r\n\r\n<strong>For Older Children and Teens: <\/strong>Since calm breathing involves taking slow, controlled breaths from the diaphragm, another way to explain this technique is to present it as <strong>\u201cbelly breathing\u201d<\/strong>. The steps for this exercise are as follows: Inhale slowly for 4 seconds through the nose. Ask your child to pretend that he or she is blowing up a balloon in the belly, so your child\u2019s belly should inflate when inhaling. Wait 2 seconds, and then slowly exhale through the mouth. Ask your child to pretend that he or she is emptying the balloon of air, so the tummy should deflate. Wait 2 seconds, and then repeat. <strong>Helpful Hint:<\/strong> When belly breathing, make sure your child\u2019s upper body (shoulders and chest area) is fairly relaxed and still. Only the belly should be moving! Step 3: Practice, practice, practice!
